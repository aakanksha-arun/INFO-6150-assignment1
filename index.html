                What is HTML?
            </summary>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
